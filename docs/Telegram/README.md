## Environment Variables

To enable the Telegram bot integration, add the following environment variables to your configuration:

```env
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=123456789,987654321
TELEGRAM_ENABLE_POLLING=true
```

### Variable Descriptions

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` | Yes | Your Telegram bot API token obtained from BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` | Yes | Comma-separated list of Telegram chat IDs that can interact with the bot |
| `TELEGRAM_ENABLE_POLLING` | No | Enable interactive bot features (commands and buttons). Set to `true` to enable, `false` or omit for notification-only mode |

## Setting Up Your Telegram Bot

### Step 1: Create a Bot with BotFather

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Start a conversation and send the command `/newbot`
3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Choose a name for your bot (e.g., "My Mantium Bot")
   - Choose a username for your bot (must end in 'bot', e.g., "my_mantium_bot")
4. BotFather will provide you with an API token that looks like this: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`
5. **Save this token** - you'll need it for the `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` environment variable

### Step 2: Get Your Chat ID

To receive messages from the bot, you need to provide your Telegram chat ID:

1. Search for [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. Start a conversation with the bot
3. It will reply with your user information, including your **ID** number
4. Copy this number - this is your chat ID

**For group chats:**
1. Add your bot to the group
2. Send a message in the group
3. Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in your browser
4. Look for the `chat` object and find the `id` field (group IDs are negative numbers)


### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add the collected information to your environment configuration:

```env
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=987654321
TELEGRAM_ENABLE_POLLING=true
```

**For multiple users/groups**, separate chat IDs with commas:
```env
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=123456789,987654321,-1001234567890
```

### Step 4: Start the Application

Once configured, start or restart your Mantium application. You should see a log message confirming the bot initialization:

```
‚úÖ Telegram bot initialized successfully and polling started
```

### Step 5: Test Your Bot

1. Open Telegram and find your bot (search for the username you created)
2. Send the `/start` command
3. You should receive a welcome message with an interactive menu

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond to commands

**Problem:** You send commands but receive no response.

**Solutions:**
- Verify `TELEGRAM_ENABLE_POLLING=true` is set in your environment
- Check that your chat ID is in the `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` list
- Restart the application and look for the initialization success message
- Ensure the bot isn't blocked by your Telegram privacy settings

### Not receiving notifications

**Problem:** New chapters are released but no notifications arrive.

**Solutions:**
- Verify `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` is correct
- Check that your chat ID is in the `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` list
- Ensure the manga tracking system is running properly
- Check application logs for any Telegram-related errors

### "Set as read" button doesn't work

**Problem:** Clicking the button shows an error or does nothing.

**Solutions:**
- This feature requires `TELEGRAM_ENABLE_POLLING=true`
- Ensure the API is running and accessible
- Check application logs for error messages
- Verify the manga ID is valid

### Bot token errors

**Problem:** Error messages about invalid token.

**Solutions:**
- Verify you copied the complete token from BotFather
- Ensure there are no extra spaces in the `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` variable
- Confirm the token hasn't been revoked in BotFather
- Try generating a new token with BotFather if needed

## Technical Details

### Callback Data Structure

The bot uses a compact JSON structure for inline button callbacks to stay within Telegram's 64-byte callback data limit:

```json
{
  "a": "action_name",
  "m": "manga_id",
  "c": "chapter_id",
  "s": status_value,
  "o": offset_value,
  "cmd": "command_type"
}
```

### API Integration

The bot communicates with the Mantium API running on `localhost` using the configured port. All manga operations (marking as read, changing status, fetching lists) go through the REST API.

### Session Management

When using interactive features like search, the bot maintains user sessions to handle multi-step interactions. Sessions are stored in memory and cleared when:
- The user completes the action
- A new command is issued
- The cancel button is clicked

## Security Considerations

1. **Keep your bot token secret** - Never share it publicly or commit it to version control
2. **Restrict chat IDs** - Only add trusted users/groups to `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS`
3. **Use HTTPS** - The Telegram API uses HTTPS by default for secure communication
4. **Monitor bot usage** - Check logs regularly for unexpected activity
